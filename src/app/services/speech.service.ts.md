### Introduction 

The `TextToSpeechService` is an Angular service responsible for converting text to speech using the browser's built-in `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` API. This service allows you to easily integrate text-to-speech functionality into your Angular application. 

### Usage

To use the `TextToSpeechService`, inject it into the component where you want to use it. Then, call the `speak()` method, passing the text you want to be spoken as an argument.

### Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { TextToSpeechService } from './text-to-speech.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.css']
})
export class MyComponent {

  constructor(private textToSpeechService: TextToSpeechService) {}

  speakText() {
    const text = 'Hello, world!';
    this.textToSpeechService.speak(text);
  }

}
```

### Code Breakdown

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

// This decorator marks the class as an Angular service
// and ensures it's available globally within the application.
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class TextToSpeechService {

  // This method takes a string as input and uses the SpeechSynthesisUtterance
  // API to speak the provided text.
  speak(text: string): void {
    const speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
    window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`@Injectable`**: This decorator registers the `TextToSpeechService` as an Angular service, making it accessible throughout the application. 
* **`providedIn: 'root'`**: This property ensures that the service is created only once and available globally within the application.
* **`speak(text: string): void`**: This method takes a string as input and performs the following actions:
    * Creates a new `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` object with the provided text.
    * Uses the `window.speechSynthesis.speak()` method to start speaking the utterance.
